Welcome to Rubyquester's Maru with twists variant for DSVO! If you are using this alongside the main DSVO mod, make sure the "MaruVariant" line in the config looks like this:

  "MaruVariant": "disable",

Additionally, there are a few options in this mod that can be changed in the config file that generates after running the game once.:

  "HospitalVariant" Maru's outfit while working at the clinic. Can be set to "lightscrubs", "darkscrubs", or "white".

  "Maternity Sprites": Can be set to "true" or "false".
